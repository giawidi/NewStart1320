<h1 class="heading_style">About Georgia's Design Studios</h1>
<p>My name is Georgia Dittmer, and I am a creative problem solver with a passion for innovative design. With 25 years of experience, I help businesses and individuals bring their ideas to life through thoughtful and strategic visuals. I have worked in government divisions, non-profit, and private sector, in which all give me different experiences into business.</p>
<p>My education started out in a technical school, which I was hired out of the classroom, into the marketing department. After that, I took online educational courses, work education courses, and now I am getting my degree at <a href="https://chattanoogastate.edu/academics?utm_source=milek-media&utm_medium=digital-ads&utm_campaign=catalog&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAwaG9BhAREiwAdhv6YxB-9MDfSMBBEDPZDW2kvYRXvJjydx0jD6Hp2CFVUE2QM0q2-lGl2BoC6XgQAvD_BwE" target="_blank">Chattanooga State College</a>.</p>
<p>My passion is working in Photoshop and taking photos. However, my experience is vast. I am skilled in many Adobe products, Microsoft applications, and some web design coding. In the print world, I have done brochures, booklets, posters, stationery, banners, and custom print folders. I also create images for web pages, social media, and I can do your headshots.</p>
