            <h1 class="heading_style">Chattanooga's Rich History</h1>
            <p>Chattanooga's history is rooted in its strategic location along the Tennessee River, which made it a key trading and transportation hub for Native American tribes, including the Cherokee. The city's modern development began in the early 19th century, following the establishment of a military fort during the Creek War and the arrival of railroads, which helped fuel its industrial growth. Chattanooga played a significant role during the Civil War, with pivotal battles like the Battle of Lookout Mountain and the Battle of Chattanooga, marking it as a key Confederate stronghold.</p>
            <p>After the war, the city transitioned into an industrial powerhouse, particularly in iron and steel production, but by the mid-20th century, it struggled with economic decline due to the collapse of its manufacturing base. In the late 20th century, Chattanooga began a remarkable revitalization, focusing on environmental sustainability, high-tech industries, and tourism.</p>

            <h2 class="heading_style">Chattanooga and The Civil War</h2>
            <p>Chattanooga, Tennessee, played a crucial role in the Civil War due to its strategic location as a major railroad hub and gateway to the Deep South. The city was the site of several significant battles in 1863, as Union forces sought to gain control of its vital transportation routes. The Battle of Chickamauga, fought just south of Chattanooga in September 1863, was a major Confederate victory and one of the bloodiest battles of the war. However, Union forces, led by General Ulysses S. Grant, regrouped and launched a successful campaign to retake the city. In November 1863, the Battles of Lookout Mountain and Missionary Ridge resulted in a decisive Union victory, breaking the Confederate siege of Chattanooga and paving the way for General William Tecumseh Sherman's advance into Georgia.</p>
            <p>The Union's victory at Chattanooga marked a turning point in the war, securing control of a critical supply line and opening the door for the Atlanta Campaign. The battles demonstrated the effectiveness of coordinated Union attacks and highlighted the leadership of Grant, who was soon promoted to command all Union armies. Chattanooga itself became a major supply and logistical base for Union forces in the South. The city's capture not only weakened the Confederacy's ability to defend its territory but also boosted Northern morale. Today, the battlefields around Chattanooga, including Chickamauga and Lookout Mountain, are preserved as part of the Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park, honoring the significance of these engagements in shaping the outcome of the Civil War.</p>

            <h2 class="heading_style">How I Use Photography in Graphic Design</h2>

            <h3>High-resolution Images</h3>
            <p>High-resolution images are digital images with a high pixel density, resulting in greater detail, clarity, and sharpness. These images are essential for professional photography, graphic design, and printing, as they maintain quality even when zoomed in or enlarged. They offer enhanced color accuracy and finer details, making them ideal for use in marketing materials, websites, and digital art. </p>

            <h3>Color Schemes</h3>
            <p>Color schemes in photography play a crucial role in setting the mood, enhancing composition, and conveying emotions. A well-chosen color palette can create harmony and visual appeal, guiding the viewer’s eye to the subject. Common color schemes include complementary colors, which use opposite hues on the color wheel for contrast, and analogous colors, which use adjacent hues for a more cohesive look. Monochromatic schemes focus on different shades of a single color to create depth and simplicity. </p>

            <h3>Photo Manipulation</h3>
            <p>Photo manipulation is a powerful technique in graphic design that involves altering or enhancing images to create visually striking compositions. It allows designers to blend multiple elements, adjust colors, add effects, and modify details to achieve a desired artistic or realistic outcome. Tools like Adobe Photoshop and GIMP enable professionals to retouch photos, remove unwanted objects, and merge images seamlessly. Photo manipulation is widely used in advertising, digital art, and branding to create compelling visuals that captivate audiences. When used ethically and skillfully, it enhances creativity and storytelling, making images more impactful and engaging.</p>
