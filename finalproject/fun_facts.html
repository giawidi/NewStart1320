                    <h3>First Coca-Coca Bottling Company</h3>
                    <p>While Atlanta is considered the home of Coca-Cola, since it was invented there, Chattanooga is home to the <a href="https://cocacolaunited.com/locations/chattanooga/" target="_blank">world’s first Coca-Cola Bottling company</a>. Two lawyers bought the bottling rights in 1899 from Coca-Cola owner Asa Candler for $1. Benjamin Thomas and Joseph Whitehead then opened the first bottling company at 17 Market Street, the current location of Patten Parkway.</p>

                    <h3>MoonPies</h3>
                    <p>Chattanooga was the birthplace of the tasty snack cake, the <a href="https://shop.moonpie.com/?srsltid=AfmBOor07ywFMS6ErywkWVXm2-e2RtlPTpkx12ABoaXDyVvoHxHy_ZDR" target="_blank">MoonPie</a> . A coal miner asked a Chattanooga Bakery traveling salesman for a snack “as big as the moon” in 1917 and the MoonPie was soon born. They were perfect for coal miners because they were filling, only cost five cents, and fit in a lunch pail. The home of the MoonPie is on Manufacturers Road and, over 100 years later, is still producing the snack cake.</p>
